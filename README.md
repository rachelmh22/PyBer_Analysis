# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a visualization for V. Isualize to see the total weekly fares for each city type by creating new dataframes and a multiple line graph. This project will help us understand how the data differs in the different city types and in turn will help the decision makers at PyBer better understand the data to create strategic plans.

## Results

Once the data has been analyzed, we can see that there are more rides and drivers in urban cities over both rural and suburban cities. Rural cities generate the least number of rides and have the least number of drivers. This in turn affects the fares. The total sum of fares is much greater in urban cities with a total of $39,854.38. Rural and suburban cities have a smaller number of total fare, with rural cities generating the lowest total fares. Since there are less rides generated in rural cities, average fare per ride is much higher in rural cities, averaging $34.62 per ride while urban cities average $24.53 per ride. However, since there are less drivers in rural cities, the average fare per driver is higher than in urban cities. A driver in rural cities average about $55.59 per fare while drivers in urban cities average $16.57 with suburban city drivers averaging between the two at $39.50. The line graph below helps to visualize the differences in the fares by each city type. As seen, there are major differences in the fares generated among the 3 city types.

##Summary

Recommendations based on the analysis are as follows:
- The city generating the most revenue are urban cities. It would be advisable to invest the most in urban cities as they generate the most rides and have the most drivers. A larger share of company resources should be directed to urban cities over suburban and rural cities. 
- Rural cities generate the smallest amount of total fares however, the average fare per ride is much higher in rural cities. If more marketing could be directed in rural cities to attract more riders, there would be higher revenue due to the average fare per ride being higher in rural cities.
- Rural cities seem to be generating a lot less than other cities, about 8 times less than urban cities in total fares. It could be helpful to conduct a study to see if PyBer should continue servicing these rural cities or if they should put their resources into urban and suburban cities instead. Since urban cities generate 8 times more than rural cities and there are 13 times more rides in urban over rural, it could be better to move out of rural cities and focus on urban and suburban cities since this is where the most revenue is generated.
